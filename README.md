# CS Project Proposal

## Rb15 Hutalla, Rb23 Puga

### Website title:

### Description:

The website will be a dress-up game in which users can create their own characters by clicking on buttons. It includes a homepage in which users can input their name, the main dress up page which allows the user to go through a selection of features and use any of their choice for the character, and finally a "picture" page that will display the finished character and a dialogue options with the user's name, so they could screenshot it and use it for any purpose they wish (profile picture, background picture, profile banner, etc)

### Website outline:

#### 1. Homepage

- It contains 2 buttons in order to redirect the user to the 2 separate web pages.

#### 2. Webpage 1 / The dress up game

- This is where the user can customize their characters with a few different options.
- Contains buttons for some parts of the character (Face, Back Hair, Front hair, Top, Bottom, Shoes)

#### 3. Webpage 2 / The dialogue options

- This will display the created character, along with a dialogue box that will feature some dialogues using the user inputted name.
- Contains buttons for different dialogue options including the name. ("Hello #name", "Hello I am #name", "My name is #name", and custom input too)
  -Contains buttons to change the inputted name, and another button to change backgrounds

### JS Incorporation

Sample of the dress up game part (not final, this is just to test if I can actually do it):
<https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dresstest>

- Save and display user's input in different texts (name): document.getElementById
- For buttons and their response: different functions for each button
- For changing the elements in the dress up game itself: setAttribute
